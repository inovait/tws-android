# Module interstitial

The Interstitial module contains an interstitial activity that behaves as a
full-screen popup and provides an interface allowing developers to easily open 
one or more popups simultaneously. It also includes extension functions for automatically 
opening popups when the TheWebSnippetManager detects new unseen popups.
