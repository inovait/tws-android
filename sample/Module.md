# Module sample

For a simpler and clearer understanding of the TWS SDK, we have prepared a sample application to help you get started.
It includes several use case examples and implementations that demonstrate how to integrate TWSView with your Android application.

You can download the sample application for free on our web page <a href="https://thewebsnippet.dev/">TheWebSnippet</a>.
The downloaded bundle provides access to a sample project, allowing you to explore how the snippet
dashboard interacts with your application.

After downloading the sample application, you'll find a sample project already set up within your organization.
This project includes several predefined snippets designed as examples. You can freely modify the content of these
snippets on the platform to explore and test all its features. 
Any changes you make will be instantly reflected in your app, allowing for real-time experimentation and testing.
