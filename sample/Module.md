# Module sample

For a simpler and clearer understanding of the TWS SDK, we have prepared a sample application to help you get started.
It includes several use case examples and implementations that demonstrate how to integrate TWSView with your Android application.

You can download the sample application for free on our web page <a href="https://thewebsnippet.dev/">TheWebSnippet</a>.
The downloaded bundle provides access to a temporary project, allowing you to explore how the snippet
dashboard interacts with your application.
