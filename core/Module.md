# Module core

The Core module of the TWS SDK provides a set of tools to seamlessly embed web
content into your Android applications using Jetpack Compose. It focuses on simplifying
the integration of web-based features and enhancing the user interface with dynamic and
customizable web views.

With the Core module, you can create, display, and interact with web snippets 
directly in your Compose-based layouts. It is designed to handle dynamic content, 
error states, loading indicators, and more, ensuring a smooth and polished user experience.

The Core module also includes web permission handling. Permissions requested by web pages, such as downloading/uploading files,
accessing the device's camera, and determining the user's location, are handled natively.

The following permissions need to be added to AndroidManifest.xml, if your web pages requires any of the following permission:

- For camera permissions, include:
  `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>`
  and
  `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="false"/>`
- For accessing the user's location, include:
  `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>`

## Installation

In your <b>module (app-level)</b> Gradle file (usually `<project>/<app-module>/build.gradle.kts` or `<project>/<app-module>/build.gradle`),
add the SDK dependency:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("com.thewebsnippet:core:{{version}}") // Contains UI Composable components for displaying web pages
}
```

## How to handle Google Login

#### Define base url while generating apk

When generating App Bundles using CLI, include the optional parameter `--google-login-base-url`. The URL should follow the format https://domain.name/path and should define the page to where user is redirected after a successful login.
*(subject of change, will be defined when web implements bundle creating)*

#### Declare website associations
1. Create an assetlinks.json file from bottom template (note that you can find pregenerated file with your app bundles):
    ```json
    [{
        "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
        "target": {
          "namespace": "android_app",
          "package_name": "com.example",
          "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["hash_of_app_certificate"]
        }
    }]
    ```
2. Replace "com.example" for the "package_name" with the actual package name
3. Replace "hash_of_app_certificate" with the actual hash, that was generated by the CLI while creating your Android apk
4. Publish generated Asset Links JSON file to your website to the following location:
    ```
    https://domain.name/.well-known/assetlinks.json
    ```
