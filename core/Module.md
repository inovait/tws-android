# Module core

The Core module provides a robust framework for integrating web views within Jetpack Compose applications through the 
WebSnippetComponent and TabWebSnippetComponent composable functions. This module enhances user experience by preserving 
scroll positions and allowing custom CSS and JavaScript injection before page loads. It facilitates Google authentication by 
handling login URL interceptions and manages permissions for sensitive actions like geolocation and camera access with 
straightforward callbacks. Additionally, the module supports file selection via a wrapped file chooser dialog.
