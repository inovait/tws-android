# Module data

The Data module serves as the backbone of the TWS SDK, providing structured data models 
used by the TWSManager and displayed through the TWSView. These models define the content, 
behavior, and dynamic properties of web snippets, enabling seamless integration of web resources 
into your app.

While the TWSManager typically manages these data objects dynamically, users can create 
their own data providers, including hardcoded or custom implementations.
