# Module manager

The Manager module of the TWS SDK is the backbone of dynamic web content handling.
It is designed to ensure that your web snippets are always up-to-date and seamlessly
integrated into your app. By leveraging WebSocket connections, the Manager module handles
everything from real-time updates to snippet visibility based on their state or expiration.
